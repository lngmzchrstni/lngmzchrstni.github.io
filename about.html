        <p>I want to become a QA (Quality Assurance) Engineer responsible for ensuring the quality and functionality of products in 
        software development. I aim to become knowledgeable in Test Planning and Strategy, Test Execution, Bug Tracking and Reporting, 
        Performance and Load Testing, and especially Automation.
        <br><br>
        I am eager to leverage my problem solving, attention to details and maintain good relationship to other people and pursue 
        opportunities where I can contribute to the success of your team while continuing to grow professionally. Through my previous roles, 
        I have developed strong problem-solving, attention to details and maintain good relationship, which I believe will be beneficial in 
        the QA software tester. For instance, while working in at MMDA as Towing and Impounding Group personnel, I maintain the accuracy of 
        all incoming and outgoing vehicle information, solving bugs and make a new features for their auto counting and separating different 
        violation excel file for incoming and outgoing vehicle. I have also committed to upskilling by <span class="span-text">"Software Quality
        Assurance Manual Testing: ISTQB Certification Foundations Training! "</span>, <span class="span-text">"Automation Software QA Testing
        Workshop: With the aid of Selenium and Computer Testing Tools!"</span>,  and <span class="span-text">"Web Development Workshop 101:
        HTML, CSS, Basic Javascript & Github!"</span>. Which has prepared me for this transition.</p>
